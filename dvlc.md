What more can be said about this man that hasn't already been said?  

He's a man of few words.  A humble man.  A warrior. A poet.

He's the kind of man you'd like to have at your side when you're facing a squadron of Nazis.

He's a man and a half.

A few more details:
* He has been known by many names:  the dark one, the traveller, Voltus Sintor...
* He is the front line in the never ending battle between good and not-so-good.
* He doesn't like peanut butter.
